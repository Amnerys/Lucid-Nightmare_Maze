# Lucid Nightmare Maze
This is my maze project for Udacity created in Unity. The player follows through waypoints until reaching up to 7 coins and one key, which is necessary to open the temple's gate. Once in the temple, the user can open the chest and restart the game clicking on the Sign post.

The name of the MAIN SCENE is called "Main" (not too creative, I know). There aren't any more scenes.
